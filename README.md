## **Objective:**
This project consists of exploratory data analysis using SQL in AWS Athena to make queries in a database. This study's main motivation is to understand the profile of credit card customers in our database and identify significant patterns that can guide strategic decision-making.

## **Data:**
The data represents information about bank customers and includes the following columns:

* age = customer's age
* gender = customer's gender (F or M)
* dependents = number of dependents of the customer
* education = customer's level of education
* annual_salary = customer's annual salary range
* card_type = customer's card type
* products_purchased = quantity of products purchased in the last 12 months
* interactions_12m = quantity of interactions/transactions in the last 12 months
* months_inactive_12m = number of months the customer was inactive
* credit_limit = customer's credit limit
* transaction_value_12m = value of transactions in the last 12 months
* transactions_12m = number of transactions in the last 12 months
